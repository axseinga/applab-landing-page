## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- BEM pattern
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in coding responsive websites and CSS. The goal was to code it fully without using Javascript. I started with mobile-first workflow however I left coding mobile navbar to the end of the project. The reason why has I encountered some difficulty with coding nav for mobile and desktop on the same HTML structure as it was my second time coding this. I added some useful links about building multi-level menus to #Useful resources. The other issue was showing and hiding the mobile menu without applying JS. I learned how to use the power of `checkbox` to display elements and make it more mobile-friendly instead of using pseudoclass `:hover`. I found a really good [article about CSS Click Events](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/12/17/css-click-events/) which shows how to imitate click events from Javascript. As well, I decided to structure my SASS however with this small project the SASS st5ructure is very minimal itself. To breathe a bit of life into the website I chose to animate the main image with pulse animation and style the buttons.
